    <p>Pizza (English: /ˈpiːtsə/ PEET-sə, Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a
         usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other 
         ingredients (such as various types of sausage, anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat, ham, etc.), 
         which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] A small pizza is sometimes called a 
         pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.
