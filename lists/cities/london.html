    <h3>London </h3>
    <img src="../img/cities-img/london.png" alt="London city ">
    <p>London is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom, with a population of just under 9 million.[1] 
        It stands on the River Thames in south-east England at the head of a 50-mile (80 km) estuary down to the North Sea,
         and has been a major settlement for two millennia.[9] The City of London, its ancient core and financial centre, 
         was founded by the Romans as Londinium and retains its medieval boundaries.[note 1][10] The City of Westminster, 
         to the west of the City of London, has for centuries hosted the national government and parliament. 
         Since the 19th century,[11] the name "London" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, 
         historically split between the counties of Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire,[12] 
         which since 1965 has largely comprised Greater London,[13] which is governed by 33 local authorities 
         and the Greater London Authority.
