        Portuguese: [ˈʁi.u d(ʒi) ʒɐˈne(j)ɾu] (listen);[a] literally 'River of January'), or simply Rio,[6] is the capital of 
        the state of the same name, Brazil's third most populous state, and the second most populous city in Brazil, after 
        São Paulo. Listed by the GaWC as a beta global city, Rio de Janeiro is the sixth most populous city in the Americas.
