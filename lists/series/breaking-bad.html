    <p>Breaking Bad is an American crime drama television series created and produced by Vince Gilligan. 
        Set and filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the series follows Walter White (Bryan Cranston), an underpaid, 
        overqualified, and dispirited high-school chemistry teacher who is struggling with a recent diagnosis of 
        stage-three lung cancer. White turns to a life of crime and partners with a former student, 
        Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), to produce and distribute methamphetamine to secure his family's financial 
        future before he dies, while navigating the dangers of the criminal underworld. The show aired on AMC from January 20, 
        2008, to September 29, 2013, consisting of five seasons for a total of 62 episodes.
