    <p>Top Gun is a 1986 American action drama film directed by Tony Scott, produced by Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, 
        with distribution by Paramount Pictures. The screenplay was written by Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr., and was inspired $

        It stars Tom Cruise as Lieutenant Pete "Maverick" Mitchell, a young naval aviator aboard the aircraft carrier USS 
        Enterprise. He and his radar intercept officer, Lieutenant (junior grade) Nick "Goose" Bradshaw (Anthony Edwards),

        San Diego, California. Kelly McGillis, Val Kilmer and Tom Skerritt also appear in supporting roles.
