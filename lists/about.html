<h3>About me</h3>

<p>
    I am a young professional seeking to immerse myself into the field of Web Development. I initially graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Visual Communications & Design from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ). 
    
    My main background lies in graphic design and UI/UX which is what motivated me to further explore the area of Web Development. 
    
    I currently completed the Le Wagon's Web Development Bootcamp in London (Graduation December 9th 2022) where I acquired skills in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript (ES6), SQL, Git, Github, Heroku and Ruby on Rails. 
    
    I am a team player with a positive cooperative attitude and keen on further expanding my skills on my new journey as a Software Engineer.
